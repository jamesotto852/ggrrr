**ggrrr** provides [**purrr**](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/)-style functions for creating [**patchwork**](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) objects.
This is primarily achieved with the `map_pwk()` family of functions which wrap around `patchwork::wrap_plots()`,
although there are also the `map_aln()` functions implemented for `patchwork::align_patches()`.

## Installation

You can install the development version of **ggrrr** from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jamesotto852/ggrrr")
```

## `map_pwk()`

First, we'll use `map_pwk()` to compare different regression models with `ggplot2::geom_smooth()`.
Let's start by generating some data:

```{r, message = FALSE}
library("tidyverse"); theme_set(theme_minimal())

set.seed(1)

df <- 
  tibble(
    x = runif(100, -10, 10),
    y = 2 + x + .2 * x^2  - .05 * x^3+ rnorm(100, sd = 5),
  )

ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point()
```

Now all we need is a function that generates plots and an object to map over.
We define `f` which creates a plot with an estimated trend line
according to the specified `formula`.
Next, we apply `f` over `formulas` to produce the desired graphic!

```{r, fig.height = 2}
library("ggrrr")

# f: formula -> ggplot object
f <- function(formula) {
  ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
    geom_smooth(formula = formula, method = "lm")
}

# list of formulas to apply f over
formulas <- list(
  y ~ x,
  y ~ poly(x, 2),
  y ~ poly(x, 3)
)

map_pwk(formulas, f)

```

The `map_pwk()` family of functions (`map_pwk()`, `map2_pwk()`, `pmap_pwk()`, etc.) all have a `.patchwork_options` argument.
This optional argument is a named list, and is passed to `patchwork::align_plots()`.
This allows for strict control over the layout of the resulting plots.
Here we show a common use case---setting the number of columns in the grid of plots.

```{r}
map_pwk(formulas, f, .patchwork_options = list(ncol = 1))
```

Finally, note that it is often convenient to use **patchwork**'s `&` operator for adding **ggplot** elements to plots in a patchwork:

```{r}
map_pwk(formulas, f, .patchwork_options = list(ncol = 1)) &
  theme(
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank()
  )
```

### A more advanced example with `pmap_pwk()`

Just like **purrr**, there are different functions for different types of inputs.
For mapping over a `data.frame` (or lists of lists), there is `pmap_pwk()`.
Here is an example in which `pmap_pwk()` is used to compare histogram and kernel density estimators:

```{r, height = 4}
# plot a geom + data combination
f <- function(geom, data) {
  ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) +
    geom
}

geoms <- list(
  geom_point(size = .5),
  geom_bin2d(),
  geom_density2d_filled()
)

datasets <- list(

  # Unimodal
  data.frame(
    x = rnorm(4e3),
    y = rnorm(4e3)
  ),

  # Bimodal
  data.frame(
    x = rnorm(4e3) + rep(c(-2, 2), length.out = 1e3),
    y = rnorm(4e3)
  ),

  # Constrained Support
  data.frame(
    x = rexp(4e3),
    y = rexp(4e3)
  )

)

# cross product between geoms and datasets,
# saved as a tibble
df_cross <-
  tidyr::expand_grid(
    geom = geoms,
    data = datasets
  )

# use pmap_pwk to apply across rows of tibble or data.frame
pmap_pwk(df_cross, f, .patchwork_options = list(ncol = 3)) &
  theme_void() &
  theme(
    legend.position = "none",
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_blank()
  )
```
